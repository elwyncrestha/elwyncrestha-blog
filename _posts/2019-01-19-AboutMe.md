I'm Elvin from Kathmandu, Nepal. Currently (January 19, 2019), I am a bachelor student studying my 2nd year in Computing.

To make it simple, I just want to say that I love programming and that is what I do.

## How am I dealing with my social anxiety?
__2018-06-18__

There are these two terms, an introvert and an extrovert. In general meaning, let me suppose two guys named Mr. ABC and Mr. XYZ. Mr. ABC enjoys meeting new peoples, likes being outspoken and is socially active. Whereas on the other side, there is this quite guy named Mr. XYZ who fears talking with strangers and is relatively inactive in social context. So in literal meaning, Mr. ABC is an extrovert and Mr. XYZ is an introvert.

I’m Elvin Shrestha and Mr. XYZ is my type of guy. I like spending most of my time in my own personal space. This personal space of mine, I find it somewhat productive and somewhat bounded by minor problems like less social communication, lots of awkward moments, useless anxieties and many more. Since my childhood, I’ve been dealing with these problem and I think I’m quite good now in establishing my social figure. There was this point of time in my life where I personally changed my social behaviour which resulted in disappearance of my social fear like the solid ice disappears when it is dipped inside the water. The change I brought in my life was quite fascinating to me because it never really felt that good when I used to approach a stranger.

Being an introvert is not a problem. The problem arises if we cannot speak, stand, talk, get involve in some activities which require our presence for its completion. For an example, while performing a drama as a narrator in my school, I used to have stage freight. A placement like a narrator is a simple job on the stage compared to other protagonist in the drama. To overcome a fear is not a minor task, it requires great deal of boldness. So, I began to involve in every extra-curricular activity in spite of the fear. I got involved in different social events related to my studies. I took part in lots of singing competition because I like singing. Even though, I never got through the audition, I always tried my best to overcome my fear. Then, this transitional phase of my life supported me to build my confidence while speaking among mass of the people. Now, I like giving presentation about some random topics that I know about. Also, my main life motive has changed since then. I love learning things and sharing to other peoples. Arguing on some informative topics is my kind of job now. Nevertheless, if I try to go to the past, I see that guy named Mr. XYZ who used to fear about minor things changing to the guy named Mr. ABC who loves communicating with wise people. So, I’m the same Elvin who is more like an ambivert now.
