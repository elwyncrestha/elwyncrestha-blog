# My Bank
It is a simple desktop application developed using C# programming language.

I started this application as a follow-up application after developing [Cafeteria](https://elwyncrestha.github.io/elwyncrestha-blog/2018/07/18/Cafeteria.html) application.

This application is very simple and can be helpful for beginners learning desktop programming using C#.

Uses:
* Database - __MSSQL__ (SQL file kept inside the repository)
